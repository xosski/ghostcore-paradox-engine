The setup (your plot)

Each point = an individual.

The axes are two different measures of “good/bad” (or however you want to name them):

X-axis: outward behavior / social impact / harm vs help

Y-axis: inner state / intention / integrity / self-awareness
(Could be any two dimensions—this is just a useful pairing.)

The plane is split into regions by the cross:

Top-right, top-left, bottom-right, bottom-left = different “moral locations.”

The label paradox (6 vs 7)

You’re proposing:

6 = “damned / hell-coded”

7 = “saved / heaven-coded”

But those are category labels, not coordinates.

So you can get:

“6 in Heaven”

A person tagged as 6 (damned) but their actual lived coordinates land in the “heaven region.”
Examples:

born into the wrong tribe, wrong doctrine, wrong paperwork—yet they live with mercy, restraint, courage.

they think they’re broken, but functionally they’re a net healer.

“7 in Hell”

A person tagged as 7 (holy) but their coordinates land in “hell region.”
Examples:

righteous performance + inner rot

“holier-than-thou” morality used as a weapon

social approval without compassion

Why it’s a paradox

Because the system is mixing two different things:

Classification (6/7): what you are called

State (coordinates): what you are doing / being

When those don’t match, the map exposes the glitch:

Judgment based on label is not judgment based on location.

The punchline (GhostCore version)

“Heaven” and “hell” stop being places you’re assigned, and become regions you inhabit—sometimes temporarily, sometimes invisibly, sometimes while wearing the opposite badge.

If you want, we can take your crosshair and name the four quadrants (and decide which axis is “harm↔help” and which is “truth↔performance”), then I can help you build a clean rule-set like:

6/7 = identity tag

Quadrant = lived reality

Drift = movement between states over time
