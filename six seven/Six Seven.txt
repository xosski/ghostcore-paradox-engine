The 6/7 Paradox Map
Proof-of-Concept White Paper (Draft v0.1)

Document ID: 67P-PoC-001
Status: Draft (conceptual / social-logic model)
Purpose: Define a testable framework where “6” and “7” are identity labels (e.g., “damned/saved,” “hell/heaven,” “bad/good”), while lived reality is represented as a coordinate position on a 2D moral-state plane—allowing for “6s in Heaven” and “7s in Hell.”

1) Abstract

This paper proposes a proof-of-concept model (“6/7 Paradox Map”) that separates classification from state:

Label (6 or 7): what an entity is called or assigned by a system (culture, religion, institution, self-image).

Location (x,y): what an entity does / embodies / produces across two independent dimensions.

By plotting individuals as points on a 2D plane, we demonstrate how categorical labels can conflict with lived outcomes: a “6” can occupy a “heaven-like” region of behavior/intention, while a “7” can occupy a “hell-like” region—revealing a systematic failure mode in label-based judgment.

2) Problem Statement

Most moral sorting systems behave like a single-bit classifier:

6 = hell / condemned

7 = heaven / redeemed

But real individuals express multi-dimensional traits (intent, impact, honesty, harm, care, courage, hypocrisy, etc.). A single-bit label cannot reliably represent multi-dimensional reality.

We want:
A model that:

preserves the existence of labels (6/7) as social artifacts,

separately models lived state, and

exposes misalignment between the two as a measurable phenomenon.

3) Definitions
3.1 Label (L)

A discrete tag assigned to an individual by an external system or internal identity.

𝐿
∈
{
6
,
7
}
L∈{6,7}

Interpretation examples (choose your mythology):

6 = damned / rejected / “hell-coded”

7 = saved / chosen / “heaven-coded”

3.2 State Vector (S)

A two-dimensional coordinate describing lived reality:

𝑆
=
(
𝑥
,
𝑦
)
S=(x,y)

Where axes are independent measures. Recommended axis pairs:

X: outward impact (harm ↔ help)

Y: inward integrity (deceit ↔ truth)
(Alternate options exist; PoC allows swapping.)

3.3 Regions (R)

The plane is partitioned into regions using a crosshair threshold:

𝑥
≥
0
x≥0 vs 
𝑥
<
0
x<0

𝑦
≥
0
y≥0 vs 
𝑦
<
0
y<0

You may assign region semantics:

Heaven Region (H): 
𝑥
≥
0
x≥0 and 
𝑦
≥
0
y≥0

Hell Region (D): 
𝑥
<
0
x<0 and/or 
𝑦
<
0
y<0 (configurable)

This yields four quadrants (“moral climates”):

Aligned Good: helps + honest (top-right)

Soft Mask: helps + dishonest (bottom-right)

Hard Truth: harms + honest (top-left)

Aligned Harm: harms + dishonest (bottom-left)

(Names are placeholders; PoC includes renaming step.)

4) Core Claim (The Paradox)

A label is not a coordinate.

Therefore:

A “6 in Heaven” is an entity where 
𝐿
=
6
L=6 but 
𝑆
∈
𝐻
S∈H

A “7 in Hell” is an entity where 
𝐿
=
7
L=7 but 
𝑆
∈
𝐷
S∈D

This mismatch is not an exception—it is an expected result whenever:

labels are assigned by simplified rules, and

real behavior is multi-dimensional and dynamic.

5) Hypotheses (PoC-Testable)

H1 — Misalignment Exists:
In any real population, there will be a non-zero rate of:

6-in-Heaven points and 7-in-Hell points.

H2 — Misalignment Increases Under Social Incentives:
If “7” status confers benefits (power, belonging, safety), the rate of 7-in-Hell increases (performative holiness / moral laundering).

H3 — Misalignment Increases Under Stigma:
If “6” status imposes stigma, punishment, or exclusion, the rate of 6-in-Heaven increases (hidden virtue / unrecognized good).

H4 — Drift Matters More Than Snapshot:
The meaningful evaluation of a person’s moral reality is often the trajectory (drift over time), not a single plotted point.

6) Mechanism Model
6.1 Why Labels Fail

Labels 
𝐿
L are typically produced by a classifier that uses proxies:

affiliation, confession, tribe, aesthetics, rhetoric, compliance signals.

State 
𝑆
S reflects lived variables:

actions, outcomes, consistency, restraint, empathy, accountability.

When proxy signals diverge from reality, mismatch occurs.

6.2 Drift (Temporal Dynamics)

Define drift as:

𝑆
(
𝑡
)
S(t): state changes over time due to stress, growth, trauma, power, community, self-awareness.

A “redeemed” person can drift downward; a “condemned” person can drift upward.

Drift metric (example):

Δ
𝑆
=
𝑆
(
𝑡
2
)
−
𝑆
(
𝑡
1
)
ΔS=S(t
2
	​

)−S(t
1
	​

)

“repentance” becomes measurable as positive drift toward H.

7) Proof-of-Concept Implementation Plan
Stage A — Choose Axes & Thresholds

Select two measurable axes (x,y).

Define how each is scored (survey, peer rating, behavioral measures, outcomes).

Set threshold = 0 (or percentile split) for crosshair.

Stage B — Assign Labels

Collect label assignments via:

self-identification (what people call themselves),

external labeling (community tags),

institutional classification.

Stage C — Plot & Quantify Misalignment

Compute:

𝑃
(
6
∩
𝐻
)
P(6∩H): proportion of 6s in Heaven region

𝑃
(
7
∩
𝐷
)
P(7∩D): proportion of 7s in Hell region

overall misalignment rate:

𝑀
=
𝑃
(
6
∩
𝐻
)
+
𝑃
(
7
∩
𝐷
)
M=P(6∩H)+P(7∩D)
Stage D — Drift Tracking

Re-measure over time:

who moves quadrants,

what predicts drift (power, isolation, suffering, support, accountability).

8) Expected Outcomes

The map will show non-trivial overlap between labels and opposite regions.

“Holiness” will cluster in ways that do not perfectly align with “holy labels.”

“Damned labels” will contain real virtue that classification systems fail to recognize.

9) Applications

Ethics systems: test whether institutions reward appearance over impact.

Community health: identify when “7 status” becomes a mask for harm.

Personal growth: track drift as a truer measure than identity tags.

Narrative design / worldbuilding: creates a formal backbone for “saint in hell / devil in heaven” story logic.

10) Limitations

Axis selection is value-laden; different communities will define “good” differently.

Measurement is noisy (self-report, observer bias).

Quadrant labels are metaphors; the model describes tendencies, not metaphysical certainty.

11) Conclusion

The 6/7 Paradox Map formalizes a simple but destabilizing truth:

People are not their labels.
They are coordinates. And coordinates move.

The model doesn’t abolish heaven/hell language—it exposes how easily systems confuse badge for being.

Appendix A — Quadrant Naming Suggestions (Optional)

If X = impact (harm↔help) and Y = integrity (deceit↔truth):

Q1 (Help + Truth): “Heaven-True”

Q2 (Harm + Truth): “Iron Mercy” / “Clean Knife”

Q3 (Help + Deceit): “Golden Mask”

Q4 (Harm + Deceit): “Hell-True” / “Rot”
