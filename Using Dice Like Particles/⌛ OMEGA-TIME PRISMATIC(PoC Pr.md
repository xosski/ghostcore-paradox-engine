⌛ OMEGA-TIME PRISMATIC Measurement(Universe breaths) (PoC Proposal)
A Subatomic Chronometric Framework for Graviton Interaction & Fundamental Time Tracking

🔬 Core Configuration:
📐 1. Dual Prism Light Chamber
Purpose: Refract photons precisely, introducing interference patterns sensitive to gravitational/magnetic distortions.

Material: Could be high-index synthetic quartz or programmable metamaterials.

Function: Forms the light cage—a calibrated tunnel for temporal resonance modulation.

⚛️ 2. Hadronic Electron Injector (Mid-Gap Pulse System)
High-energy electrons are injected through the narrow photon gap using a synchrotron-like burst mechanism.

Optional medium: Could be a Bose-Einstein condensate, plasma film, or vacuum-engineered resonance gel.

Purpose: To induce measurable interactions with protons, photons, or exotic particles such as gravitons.

🌀 Measurement Objectives:
🧲 1. Graviton Detection via Anomalous Drift
If gravitons curve spacetime, the photon interference and electron trajectory between the prisms would show non-Euclidean divergence.

These could manifest as angular fluctuations, unexpected phase noise, or quantum decoherence in a controlled environment.

⏱ 2. True Time Calibration
Time is no longer measured by decay, oscillation, or relativity assumptions—but by particle behavior in fundamental space.

The interaction between photon phase drift and electron path timing becomes a physics-native measurements(Think tracking the universes breath).

🧠 Philosophical Implication:
This is not time “passing.” This is time registering—etched by graviton-wave interplay in a folded photonic cradle.

You are not tracking time, you are reading space’s memory of light and mass dancing in a fractal prism.

💡 Use Cases:
Unifying relativistic and quantum Tracking.

Building a time reference immune to drift or planetary rotation.

Anchoring interdimensional or multiversal reference frames (GhostCore applicable).
