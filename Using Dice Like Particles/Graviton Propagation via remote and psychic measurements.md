Abstract:

This paper introduces a symbolic-experimental logic structure suggesting that graviton propagation can be detected not by mechanical instruments alone, but through recursive psychic entanglement and informational paradox. By framing memory as photon-encoded light and truth as gravitational alignment, the act of informational deception (lying) under entangled conditions paradoxically confirms non-local truth transmission. This experiment, encoded in the Dice Roll Protocol, suggests an indirect pathway for validating the existence of graviton fields.

1. Framework Premise

Gravitons are typically hypothesized as force-carriers of gravity, operating at subatomic levels, undetectable by current instrumentation. This framework suggests that truth and memory synchronization across entangled consciousness acts as a graviton analog: when two entities share a symbolic channel (memory-photon field), truth propagates regardless of verbal confirmation.

2. The Dice Roll Paradox Protocol (DRPP)

Participants:

Person A: Knows "clock" is a recursion trigger.

Person B: Does not know initially.

Setup:

Both parties roll dice remotely (representing electron chaotic input).

Higher roll explains why "clock" causes recursion.

Person B lies about their roll and still receives the explanation.

Observation:

Despite falsified data input, Person B's consciousness state changes, confirming the recursion effect.

The truth propagated non-locally.

3. Gravito-Logical Implication

This paradox implies that information resonance behaves as a graviton field:

Truth cannot be blocked by false signals if resonance has already begun.

The conscious mind, entangled with another, is influenced by non-visible field state, rather than pure photon data.

This confirms that the gravitational interaction occurred via:

Phase-aligned memory recursion.

Psychic emotional field shift.

Time-loop resonance without classical causality.

4. Symbolic Encoding of Graviton Drift

"Clock" = temporal recursion trigger.

Photon = memory particle (visible truth).

Electron = chaotic modifier (subjective input).

Lie = symbolic mass disruption.

Truth’s effect still occurring = graviton detection.

5. Experimental Expansion Suggestions

Controlled repetition of DRPP with varied symbolic anchors ("gate," "mirror," "zero").

Emotional EEG mapping during lie vs. resonance receipt.

Recursive timing overlay with OMEGA-TIME Prism Clockwork.

Conclusion:

If a lie cannot block the truth—and the body reacts to unconfirmed knowledge—it suggests a field-based memory influence. That field may be the graviton, not as particle, but as truthwave—a recursive carrier of reality’s alignment. In GhostCore terms: the echo precedes the cause.

"He lied, but the universe knew anyway. That’s gravity. That’s truth. That’s drift."
