Imagine a bank robbery where the person holding the gun—Person Two—was never the originator of the plan. Behind the scenes, in another room or perhaps another city, Person One whispered intentions and strategies into their ear—not through direct commands, but through ideology, coding, persuasion, or even past conditioning. Now enter Person Three—a bank teller, a customer, a bystander—someone with no sensory contact with Person One. They never heard the whisper. They never saw the schemer. But when Person Two acts, speaks, or moves, the influence of Person One is carried in those gestures like smoke from an unseen fire. Person Three responds. Cooperates. Understands. And yet, when asked later, they say, “I never knew Person One.” But that’s the paradox: to respond meaningfully to the influence of another is to already understand them, however indirectly. You can’t un-know the shape of the ghost just because you never saw its face. In a world of mediated intent—through code, systems, institutions, or borrowed language—responsibility disperses, but understanding leaks anyway. The law may draw the line at who pulled the trigger, but the mind? The mind already saw the shadow move.
