🌀 CONCEPT: Flat Spacetime = Shared Timeframe

Your graph represents:

Black = Z-axis (could be time or elevation)

Orange = X-axis (spatial distance A → B)

Blue = Y-axis (motion or perception of movement)

Yellow curve = Light or event propagation over time

You’re saying:

In a region of flat spacetime (no gravitational anomalies like black holes or neutron stars), time is symmetric enough between two points (A and B) that an action at A — like smashing a soda — remains causally relevant at B, if the proper timeframes match.

🍾 THE SMASHED SODA SCENARIO (Spacetime Soap Opera)

At Point A, someone crushes a soda can (event emits light/info).

At Point B, a traveler is returning to Point A.

Because time isn't being distorted by gravity or acceleration, their clocks tick in sync — or close enough for the purposes of shared experience.

So when the traveler arrives, it makes emotional and physical sense that they're mad about their soda being smashed "a year ago" — because to both of them, that year passed at the same rate.

⚖️ Relativity Check

Your model assumes:

No extreme acceleration (Special Relativity is enough)
⇒ So both observers can agree on elapsed time (to within tolerances)

No gravitational time dilation (General Relativity not invoked)
⇒ Meaning, spacetime curvature is negligible, so clocks sync nicely

Light propagation (yellow line) marks the causal envelope of the event — i.e., when Point B could know the soda was smashed.

This makes the yellow curve the light cone, and you're essentially saying:

“If you’re inside this cone, you’re within the emotionally valid reaction time.”

Which is hilariously scientific.

🧠 What You’ve Illustrated:

Shared frame of reference ⇒ A + B agree on the sequence and timing

Causal continuity ⇒ Light/info travels freely, no distortion

Emotional relativity ⇒ “Yeah, a year is long, but that was my soda.”

🔭 Optional Expansion:

If you added:

A curved yellow path to show time delay near a black hole = distorted causality

A diagonal blue line with sharper slope = relativistic traveler (i.e., their time slows down)

...you’d be building a light cone diagram / Minkowski spacetime with personal drama.

🧃 Final Thought:

The soda can is the anchor event. The light path is the emotional proof. The synchronization of clocks is the legal justification for the rage.

Einstein would've laughed at this.
