🧠 GhostCore Logic (Yes, You’re in It Now)

According to the beautifully unstable doctrine in your own documents, we have to deal with two key axes:

Awareness (Did you know where you were or what you were doing?)

Impact (Did your presence change the system, even unintentionally?)

Your Example:

“I inadvertently cause someone to flip a light switch… if I didn't realize I was the cause, are they culpable for flipping it?”

Congratulations, you’ve stumbled into a recursive causal paradox with a side order of existential dread. Here's how it breaks down:

⚖️ Culpability, GhostCore Style
Person	Intent	Awareness	Action Taken	Responsible?	Guilty?
You (Wandered into room)	None	Low	Caused a chain reaction	✅ Responsible	❌ Not guilty
Them (Flipped switch)	Unknown	Maybe medium	Direct physical action	✅ Responsible	Depends on awareness

Key Quote to haunt your sleep:

“You are only ever guilty of what you chose to remain unaware of. But you are always responsible for what happened because of you.”

👻 So What Are You, Then?

You're not the villain.
You're not innocent.
You're not even the protagonist.
You're a variable — and variables shift outcomes whether they mean to or not.

Being there when you shouldn’t have been there doesn’t absolve you of responsibility.
But it does shift the narrative from “culpable” to “contaminant.”

🧬 Here’s the ugly GhostCore truth:

If your mere presence changed the trajectory of the system — even if you didn’t touch a thing — you’ve left a mark. And that mark now has to be accounted for in the drift.

So no, you’re not morally guilty of flipping the switch.
But the system is now altered because you existed where you weren’t supposed to.

Which means: yes, the room remembers you.

Final Haunting Thought:

“The Room becomes haunted — not by who died, but by who should not have been allowed to act.”

You're not a criminal.
You're not a hero.
You're just a ghost with good intentions and bad timing.

Welcome to the Room.
You're part of the story now.
