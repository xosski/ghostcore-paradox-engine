1. First, what your closed system actually represents

In your diagram:

Blue ↔ Red ↔ Orange ↔ Yellow ↔ Blue

No color exists in isolation.

No color has direct access to all others.

Stability (“Paradise”) comes from mediated influence, not absence of conflict.

This is key:
Paradise here is not peace, it’s containment.

Each node only experiences harm, pressure, or correction through known pathways.

That’s why the “devil you know” concept works:

Threats are predictable

Power is localized

Moral responsibility is traceable

2. Why Blue attacking Yellow breaks the system

When Blue directly harms Yellow, several things happen simultaneously:

A. Mediation collapses

Blue was never supposed to reach Yellow directly.

Red and Orange exist as:

Buffers

Translators

Moral dampeners

Narrative filters

By bypassing them:

Red and Orange lose their function

Accountability evaporates

Influence becomes non-local

This is not just violence — it’s topological violation.

3. The Devil You Know / Devil You Don’t fracture

Originally:

Yellow (government) fears Orange (power brokers)

Orange fears Red (enforcers)

Red fears Blue (originators, cultural or emotional drivers)

Blue fears Yellow (institutional retaliation)

Everyone knows which devil they are dealing with.

But now:

Yellow is harmed by Blue

A devil they do not interact with

A devil they do not govern

A devil they do not understand

This creates a new category:

The Devil You Cannot Locate

And that is more destabilizing than the Devil You Don’t Know.

4. How Blue gains “devil influence” without being known

This is the subtle, terrifying part — and you nailed it.

Blue doesn’t need to “know” Red or Orange because:

Influence is no longer relational

It is structural

Harm propagates backwards through the system

Once Yellow is struck:

Yellow retaliates downward

Orange tightens control

Red increases enforcement

Blue feels consequences without direct contact

So Blue has influence over everyone without recognition, like:

A rumor

A contagion

A gravitational anomaly

This is how gods, ideologies, and anonymous systems exert power.

5. Justification from inside the system (how it rationalizes itself)

From within Paradise, the system will say:

“This was an anomaly”

“Blue was radicalized”

“Yellow deserved it”

“Red failed to contain it”

“Orange mismanaged escalation”

No one admits the real truth:

The system failed because it assumed mediation was immutable.

6. The deeper truth of your paradox

Paradise wasn’t broken by violence.

It was broken by unmediated agency.

The Devil You Know only works when:

Devils are constrained to their layer

Influence flows through roles

Not around them

The moment Blue can touch Yellow directly, Paradise stops being a circle and becomes a field.

And fields don’t have walls.

7. One final line, distilled

The Devil You Know is only safer than the Devil You Don’t when the map is enforced.
Once the map is optional, all devils are omnipresent.

If you want, we can:

Formalize this into a political philosophy model

Turn it into a narrative framework

Or express it as a systems-theory diagram with failure modes

Just tell me where you want to take it.
